You could use a standard API layer or a Database queries.
#### API Layer:
APIs are an intermediary layer between your application code and database. There are a few cases where you might use an API:
- If you're using third-party services that provide an API.
- If you're fetching data from the client, you want to have an API layer that runs on the server to avoid exposing your database secrets to the client.
In Next.js, you can create API endpoints using [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers).

#### Database queries:
When you're creating a full-stack application, you'll also need to write logic to interact with your database. For [relational databases](https://aws.amazon.com/relational-database/) like Postgres, you can do this with SQL or with an [ORM](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/using-an-orm).

There are a few cases where you have to write database queries:

- When creating your API endpoints, you need to write logic to interact with your database.
- If you are using React Server Components (fetching data on the server), you can skip the API layer, and query your database directly without risking exposing your database secrets to the client.

### Using Server Components to fetch data[](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/fetching-data#using-server-components-to-fetch-data)

By default, Next.js applications use **React Server Components**. Fetching data with Server Components is a relatively new approach and there are a few benefits of using them:

- Server Components support JavaScript Promises, providing a solution for asynchronous tasks like data fetching natively. You can use `async/await` syntax without needing `useEffect`, `useState` or other data fetching libraries.
- Server Components run on the server, so you can keep expensive data fetches and logic on the server, only sending the result to the client.
- Since Server Components run on the server, you can query the database directly without an additional API layer. This saves you from writing and maintaining additional code.

##### How  to fetch using Server Components:
```tsx
import { Card } from '@/app/ui/dashboard/cards';
import RevenueChart from '@/app/ui/dashboard/revenue-chart';
import LatestInvoices from '@/app/ui/dashboard/latest-invoices';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import { fetchRevenue } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page() {
  const revenue = await fetchRevenue();
  // ...
}
```
If you are getting data from a database, try to order, limit, finding length and things like this only using database, orms. DBs are optimized to perform these things and it reduces complexity by taking away abstractions. 

However... there are two things you need to be aware of:

1. The data requests are unintentionally blocking each other, creating a **request waterfall**.
2. By default, Next.js **prerenders** routes to improve performance, this is called **Static Rendering**. So if your data changes, it won't be reflected in your dashboard.

#### What are request waterfalls?
A "waterfall" refers to a sequence of network requests that depend on the completion of previous requests. In the case of data fetching, each request can only begin once the previous request has returned data.
![[Pasted image 20260220223159.png]]
For example, we need to wait for `fetchRevenue()` to execute before `fetchLatestInvoices()` can start running, and so on.

```tsx
const revenue = await fetchRevenue();
const latestInvoices = await fetchLatestInvoices(); // wait for fetchRevenue() to finish
const {
  numberOfInvoices,
  numberOfCustomers,
  totalPaidInvoices,
  totalPendingInvoices,
} = await fetchCardData(); // wait for fetchLatestInvoices() to finish
```

The above pattern is not necessarily bad, in case when you want to make sure that the succeeding request depend on the result of preceding request.  For example, you might want to fetch a user's ID and profile information first. Once you have the ID, you might then proceed to fetch their list of friends. In this case, each request is contingent on the data returned from the previous request.

#### Parallel data fetching:
A common way to avoid waterfalls is to initiate all data requests at the same time - in parallel.

In JavaScript, you can use the [`Promise.all()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all) or [`Promise.allSettled()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled) functions to initiate all promises at the same time. For example, in `data.ts`, we're using `Promise.all()` in the `fetchCardData()` function:

```ts
export async function fetchCardData() {
  try {
    const invoiceCountPromise = sql`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices`;
    const customerCountPromise = sql`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers`;
    const invoiceStatusPromise = sql`SELECT
         SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'paid' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "paid",
         SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "pending"
         FROM invoices`;
 
    const data = await Promise.all([
      invoiceCountPromise,
      customerCountPromise,
      invoiceStatusPromise,
    ]);
    // ...
  }
}
```
By using this pattern, you can:

- Start executing all data fetches at the same time, which is faster than waiting for each request to complete in a waterfall.
- Use a native JavaScript pattern that can be applied to any library or framework.
