JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup.

## Passing strings with quotes

When you want to pass a string attribute to JSX, you put it in a single or double quotes:

```JSX
export default function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src="https://react.dev/images/docs/scientists/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
      alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
    />
  );
}
```

Here, `"https://react.dev/images/docs/scientists/7vQD0fPs.jpg"` and `"Gregorio Y. Zara"` are being passed as strings.

But what if you want to dynamically specify the `src` or `alt` text? You could **use a value from JavaScript by replacing `"` and `"` with `{` and `}`**:

```JSX
export default function Avatar() {
  const avatar = 'https://react.dev/images/docs/scientists/7vQD0fPs.jpg';
  const description = 'Gregorio Y. Zara';
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={avatar}
      alt={description}
    />
  );
}
```

## Using curly braces: A window into the JS world

JSX is a special way of writing JS. That means it's possible to use JS inside it - with curly braces `{ }`. The example below first declares a name for the scientist, `name`, then embeds it with curly braces inside the `<h1>`:

```JSX
export default function TodoList() {
  const name = 'Gregorio Y. Zara';
  return (
    <h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1>
  );
}
```

Any JS expression will work between curly braces, including function calls.

### Where to use curly braces

You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:

1. **As text** directly inside a JSX tag: `<h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1>` works, but `<{tag}>Gregorio Y. Zara's To Do List</{tag}>` will not.
2. **As attributes** immediately following the `=` sign: `src={avatar}` will read the `avatar` variable, but `src="{avatar}"` will pass the string `"{avatar}"`.

## Using "double curlies": CSS and other objects in JSX

In addition to strings, numbers, and other JavaScript expressions, you can even pass objects in JSX. Objects are also denoted with curly braces, like `{ name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }`. Therefore, to pass a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in another pair of curly braces: `person={{ name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }}`.

You may see this with inline CSS styles in JSX. React does not require you to use inline styles (CSS classes work great for most cases). But when you need an inline style, you pass an object to the `style` attribute:

```JSX
export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <ul style={{
      backgroundColor: 'black',
      color: 'pink'
    }}>
      <li>Improve the videophone</li>
      <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
      <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
    </ul>
  );
}
```

_Note: Inline style properties are written in camelCase._

## Recap

Now you know almost everything about JSX:

- JSX attributes inside quotes are passed as strings.
- Curly braces let you bring JavaScript logic and variables into your markup.
- They work inside the JSX tag content or immediately after `=` in attributes.
- `{{` and `}}` is not special syntax: it’s a JavaScript object tucked inside JSX curly braces.
